"The three-part book is a guide for those who are already envolved in this"
" industry and prepared for a deep dive in various topics more cutting-"
"edge and theoretical. Starting with introductions to basic math model "
"like physical model and data-driven model theoretically, the book then "
"briefs tools to fulfill the needs of various simulation tasks, concerning"
" BIM application, parametric design and cloud compute supports... The "
"third and the last part of the book goes deep into some buzz topics in "
"this field: human behaviour in building operation, simulation assisted "
"green building labeling, load prediction on urban scale, HVAC system "
"simulation commisssioning, demand reponse, co-simulation, object-oriented"
" simulation and so on. Cases are studied in conjunction with each method "
"introduced."

"This book systematically introduces readers to the operator method, which"
" can be used in different stages of urban planning. Energy planning "
"should ideally be accompanied by urban planning, ranging from "
"comprehensive planning and detailed planning, to the design of individual"
" construction projects. This book discusses a range of methods and models"
" for defining energy planning objectives; analyzing and predicting energy"
" demand; assessing available energy resources; optimizing integrated "
"energy systems; analyzing the cost-effectiveness of proposals; "
"implementation management; and post-assessment. Part one focuses on "
"energy planning in different urban planning stages, while part two "
"provides detailed discussions of key issues related to energy planning."

" BPS, standards both foreign and domestic, basic theories and principles,"
" softwares and how to use them. Mainly based on eQUEST, EnergyPlus and "
"TRNSYS, 25 cases of various building and system types will be present "
"step by step to help you accquire basic skills of BPS, including typical "
"simulation routines, LEED labeling, co-simulation, calibrated simulation "
"and district load estimation... All IO files are packed within the disk "
"attached with this book. You may also download them on our website."
